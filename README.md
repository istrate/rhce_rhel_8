# Redhat Certified Engineer Exam Notes

These are my notes for preparation in taking the RedHat Certified Engineer (RHCE) certification exam using RHEL 8.

I have already been using Ansible extensively for 2 years, so the notes are not comprehensive in covering all exam objectives; just the areas where I felt I was lacking knowledge and/or experience in using Ansible.
